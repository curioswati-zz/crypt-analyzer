  "body": "### Welcome to Crypt Analyzer.\r\n\r\nIt is a tool to compare some Encryption Algorithms.\r\nThe website is live at: http://54.169.89.143\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n* The algorithms it covers are, AES, Triple-DES, Blowfish, Twofish and RC6.\r\n* Analysis is done for both Encryption and Decryption.\r\n* It accept any type of file as input. The file size is restricted to 100MB.\r\n* It provides two type of analysis:\r\n    * File size variant: Can compare the algorithms using different input file size.\r\n    * Key size variant: Can compare the algorithms using different input key size.\r\n* Provide facility to export result analysis chart.\r\n* Also provides configuration of the underlying system.\r\n\r\n### Usage Instructions:\r\n\r\nThe website is self explanatory. The procedure is as follows:\r\n\r\n* Select a method from the given four choices.\r\n* Select algorithms to compare. You can also select single algorithm to see it's performance.\r\n* Upload files and click submit.\r\n* You can see the result graph on the next page. You can also export the graph as PNG.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n\r\nIf you want to report the software, need help or want to suggest changes you can contact me at @swati12jaiswal or drop me a mail at jaiswalswati94atTheRAteGMail Dot com.",
